        <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
        <hr/>

        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>

        <p>
            Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, 
            lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the 
            other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well-thumbed copy of 
            <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favourite book since college, 
            and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed 
            to be free.
        </p>

        <p>
            She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with 
            an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who 
            have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, 
            unraveling the secrets of the llama 
            <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding 
            achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
